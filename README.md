This is a collaboration between myself and Pearl Hamilton.  Our goal is to create a package of random functions that do all sorts of random things!

So far, we have created a function that describes a journey from London to Colombia.  We are in the process of designing a function that converts string inputs to Pascal Case.

Watch this space for updates!
